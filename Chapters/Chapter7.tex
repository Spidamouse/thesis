This chapter will describe issues found during the project, but were not covered in the previous chapters. In addition to describing the issues, if applicable, the corrections to resolve these issues will be given. If the issues were unresolved, a suggestion at the possible causes for the issue will be given. Section \ref{Ch7 Sec1} details the issues discovered during matrix mode.

\section{Matrix Mode Bugs}

\label{Ch7 Sec1}

As discussed in chapter \ref{Chapter 5}, by implementing letterboxing into matrix mode several minor bugs were also introduced.

\subsection{Character Duplication}

\label{Ch7 Sec1 Sub1}

After letterbox implementation, a strange phenomenon occurred on the left side of the screen when in matrix mode. It appears that there is a region, about four character wide, that contains duplicates of characters from the next line. In addition to this duplicate, there appears to be smearing of the first two characters in this duplicate region. These observations can be seen in figure \ref{fig:matrixmodecharacterinputerror}. In addition to the issues with the left region, it is believed that these issues are causing the screen to become shifted to the right. As seen in figure \ref{fig:matrixmodecharacterinputerror}, the characters are continuing past the right most visible point of the screen.
