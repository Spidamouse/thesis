\section{Research Question Answers}

\label{Ch9 Sec2}

\textit{What are the missing or non-functional sub-systems that the MEGA65 requires to be implemented?}\\
The missing and/or non-functional sub-systems of the MEGA65 are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Save state Saving and Loading}
\item{Secure mode Saving and Loading}
\item{Secure mode ACCEPT and REJECT Implementation}
\item{SD card Read Protection}
\item{CPU Lock Protection}
\item{Matrix mode Key Scanning}
\end{itemize}

\textit{How can these sub-systems be implemented?}\\
These sub-systems can be implemented as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{balh}
\end{itemize}

\textit{How can the simplicity, understandability and hence, the security of these sub-systems be maximised?}\\
blah
\\
\textit{How can the complete MEGA65 architecture be physically prototyped on the bench?}\\
blah
\\
\textit{How can the secure compartmentalisation's architecture planned for the MEGA65 be realised?}\\
balh
